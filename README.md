# 30 day Workout

A 30 day workout app for a Fibit Versa. You pick a challenge, say planks or wall sits. Start the app and use the timer. Each day the interval will ajust until you complete all 30 days. There are a few rest days in there as well.

## Why?

My wife wanted a 30 workout challenge app so I made her one. Fibit's API is surprisingly easy to use.

## Can I use it?

Sure. You can download the beta here: https://gam.fitbit.com/gallery/app/1522f0f0-5657-4909-876d-f8a73f1ea33f

## Can I steal all your code?

It's MIT. Go nuts.
